# Traffic_Data_Analysis

Traffic Maintenance is a major challenge for human societies because of its social and 
economic impacts. Various technologies have considerably paved the way for the 
elimination of traffic problems and have been able to effectively detect drivers' violations. 
This can be controlled easily with the help of new technology as this society is developing 
quickly. Violation problems are also increasing therefore we have to take advantage of 
the new technology to incorporate better Traffic regulations. However, the high volume 
of the real-time data collected from surveillance cameras and traffic sensors along with 
the data obtained from individuals have made the use of traditional methods ineffective. </br>
Therefore, using Hadoop for processing large scale structured and unstructured data as 
well as multimedia data can be of great help. In this Traffic violation detection system 
based on the Map Reduce techniques and deep learning was employed to discover 
effective solutions.
